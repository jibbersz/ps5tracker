Base project for ps5 tracker

Relies on two files:

urls.csv - contains information about the exact product URL, stock messages and product descriptions
instock.csv - tracks currently alerted in stock items

Historical project, code may no longer be functional - particularly due to drastic changes to the Twitter API since this was built
